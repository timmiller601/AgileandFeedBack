# Agile and Feedback Reflection

## 1. 
### Thinking back to my previous career path we were definitely subject to the waterfall method. The company that we contracted to build our websites made a ton of money and we got a subpar product. from a deveolpement standpoint the agile method allows you to chew off small pieces of the project and makes it easier for you to pivot to a new direction if needed. the waterfall method requires more meetings than anyone should be apart of to answer one simple question, and one that probably didnt need to be asked in the first place.

### We used waffle as a way to build a checklist so everyone was on the same page. As a team we decided to use driver navigator, so we would talk through each part of the project tackling what we thought needed to be tackeled first, and only misjudging a few times.

### I felt My role on the team was relationship building. 

## 4.
### I liked how we tackled the project as a group, we worked well together and tackled each problem as a team. If I would change one thing it is allowing us to divy out two or three problems take them home and bring them back to one another and go through everyones solutions. just as a way to build our own muscle memory. 

### 5.
## We used the retro almost daily without realizing it. We would make sure that we wrapped up the day, and knew what we were planning to work on the next day. We had almost daily check-ins with one another. That is how I would envision it to work in the future.

## I probably facilitated most of the retros by ensuring we all had a chance to talk 

### 7. 
## After being a summer camp director for 10 years. I feel good about my abilty to take and give feedback in a positive manner and, I am always trying to improve. My communication toolbox is full and is getting rusty from not being used as much lately. I just need more practice being in uncomfortable situations to use those skills I gained throughout my career.
